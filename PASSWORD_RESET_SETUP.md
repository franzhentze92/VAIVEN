# Password Reset Setup Guide

## What I've Added

I've implemented a complete password reset system for your CargoConnect application:

1. **Enhanced AuthContext** - Added `sendPasswordResetEmail` and `resetPassword` methods
2. **ForgotPassword Page** - `/forgot-password` route for requesting password reset emails
3. **ResetPassword Page** - `/reset-password` route for setting new passwords
4. **Updated Login Page** - Added "Forgot Password" link
5. **New Routes** - Added to your main App.tsx

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Environment File
Create a `.env` file in your project root with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### 2. Get Supabase Credentials
1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings > API
4. Copy the Project URL and anon/public key

### 3. Configure Supabase Auth Settings
In your Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to Authentication > URL Configuration
2. Set your Site URL to: `http://localhost:8080`
3. Add these redirect URLs:
   - `http://localhost:8080/reset-password`
   - `http://localhost:8080/forgot-password`

### 4. Test the System
1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `http://localhost:8080/login`
3. Click "Â¿Olvidaste tu contraseÃ±a?"
4. Enter your email
5. Check your email for the reset link
6. Click the link to reset your password

## How It Works

1. **Request Reset**: User enters email on `/forgot-password`
2. **Email Sent**: Supabase sends password reset email with secure link
3. **Reset Password**: User clicks email link, goes to `/reset-password`
4. **Set New Password**: User enters and confirms new password
5. **Success**: Password is updated and user is redirected to login

## Troubleshooting

- **"Missing Supabase environment variables"**: Check your `.env` file
- **"Invalid or expired link"**: Links expire after 1 hour, request a new one
- **"Connection refused"**: Make sure your dev server is running on port 8080
- **Email not received**: Check spam folder and Supabase email settings

## Security Features

- Password reset links expire after 1 hour
- Secure token-based authentication
- Password validation (minimum 6 characters)
- Confirmation password matching
- Proper error handling and user feedback

Your password reset system is now fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
