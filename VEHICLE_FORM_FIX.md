# Vehicle Form Fix - Transporter Dashboard

## Problem Identified

The vehicle registration form in the transporter dashboard was not saving all the vehicle details. When a transporter added a new vehicle, only 3 fields were being saved:
- `name`
- `plate` 
- `vehicle_type`

All other fields like brand, model, year, color, capacity, dimensions, fuel type, etc. were being displayed in the form but not captured or saved to the database.

## Root Cause

1. **Limited State**: The `newVehicle` state only had 3 fields defined
2. **Incomplete Database Insert**: The `addVehicle` function only inserted the basic 3 fields
3. **Form Fields Not Bound**: The form inputs were not connected to the state

## What I Fixed

### 1. Extended the `newVehicle` State
Added all missing fields to the state:
```typescript
const [newVehicle, setNewVehicle] = useState<{ 
  name: string; 
  plate: string; 
  vehicle_type: string; 
  brand: string; 
  model: string; 
  year: string; 
  color: string; 
  capacity_kg: string; 
  axle_count: string; 
  length_m: string; 
  width_m: string; 
  height_m: string; 
  fuel_type: string; 
  emission_standard: string; 
  gps_tracking: boolean; 
  owner_type: string; 
}>({ /* ... */ });
```

### 2. Updated the `addVehicle` Function
Modified the database insert to save all fields:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('transporter_vehicles')
  .insert({
    user_id: user.id,
    name: newVehicle.name,
    vehicle_type: newVehicle.vehicle_type,
    plate: newVehicle.plate || null,
    brand: newVehicle.brand || null,
    model: newVehicle.model || null,
    year: newVehicle.year ? parseInt(newVehicle.year) : null,
    color: newVehicle.color || null,
    capacity_kg: newVehicle.capacity_kg ? parseFloat(newVehicle.capacity_kg) : null,
    axle_count: newVehicle.axle_count ? parseInt(newVehicle.axle_count) : null,
    length_m: newVehicle.length_m ? parseFloat(newVehicle.length_m) : null,
    width_m: newVehicle.width_m ? parseFloat(newVehicle.width_m) : null,
    height_m: newVehicle.height_m ? parseFloat(newVehicle.height_m) : null,
    fuel_type: newVehicle.fuel_type || null,
    emission_standard: newVehicle.emission_standard || null,
    gps_tracking: newVehicle.gps_tracking,
    owner_type: newVehicle.owner_type || null,
  })
```

### 3. Connected Form Fields to State
Updated all form inputs to use `value` and `onChange` props:
```typescript
<Input 
  value={newVehicle.brand} 
  onChange={(e) => setNewVehicle({...newVehicle, brand: e.target.value})} 
  placeholder="Marca (ej. Volvo)" 
/>

<Switch 
  checked={newVehicle.gps_tracking} 
  onCheckedChange={(checked) => setNewVehicle({...newVehicle, gps_tracking: checked})} 
/>
```

### 4. Reset Form After Submission
Updated the form reset to clear all fields:
```typescript
setNewVehicle({ 
  name: '', 
  plate: '', 
  vehicle_type: '', 
  brand: '', 
  model: '', 
  year: '', 
  color: '', 
  capacity_kg: '', 
  axle_count: '', 
  length_m: '', 
  width_m: '', 
  height_m: '', 
  fuel_type: '', 
  emission_standard: '', 
  gps_tracking: false, 
  owner_type: '' 
});
```

## Fields Now Being Saved

âœ… **Basic Information**
- Name
- License Plate
- Vehicle Type

âœ… **Manufacturer Details**
- Brand
- Model
- Year
- Color

âœ… **Specifications**
- Capacity (kg)
- Axle Count
- Length (m)
- Width (m)
- Height (m)

âœ… **Technical Details**
- Fuel Type
- Emission Standard
- GPS Tracking
- Owner Type

## Database Schema

The database already had all these fields available in the `transporter_vehicles` table:
- `brand`, `model`, `year`, `color`
- `capacity_kg`, `axle_count`
- `length_m`, `width_m`, `height_m`
- `fuel_type`, `emission_standard`
- `gps_tracking`, `owner_type`

## Testing

1. **Build Success**: The application builds without errors
2. **Form Binding**: All form fields are now properly connected to state
3. **Data Persistence**: All vehicle details will be saved to the database
4. **Edit Functionality**: The edit form already had all fields working correctly

## Result

Now when a transporter registers a new vehicle:
1. All form fields are properly captured
2. All data is saved to the database
3. When editing, all previously entered details will be displayed
4. The form provides a complete vehicle registration experience

The vehicle form is now fully functional and will save all the details that transporters enter! ðŸš›âœ…
